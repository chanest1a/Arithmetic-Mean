📌 Arithmetic Mean Calculator
📖 About
This Python program is a simple tool that calculates the arithmetic mean of two or three numbers entered by the user. It performs different operations based on the user's selection and displays the result on the screen.

🚀 Features
✅ User-friendly input system – The program prompts users to select an option before entering numbers.
✅ Supports two or three numbers – Users can choose to calculate the arithmetic mean of either two or three numbers.
✅ Error handling – If an invalid option is selected, the program displays an error message.

🛠️ How to Use
1️⃣ Run the program in a Python-supported environment.
2️⃣ Choose an option:

Option 1: Calculates the arithmetic mean of two numbers.
Option 2: Calculates the arithmetic mean of three numbers.
3️⃣ Enter the required numbers when prompted.
4️⃣ The program will compute and display the result.
🎯 Example Scenarios
Selecting Option 1 and entering two numbers will return their arithmetic mean.
Selecting Option 2 and entering three numbers will return their arithmetic mean.
Entering an invalid option will trigger an error message.
📌 Future Improvements
🔹 Add enhanced error handling for non-numeric inputs.
🔹 Implement a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.
🔹 Expand functionality to include other statistical calculations like median and mode.
